# Smell-Detector
A RPI project for logging the smell in classrooms for statistical analysis

## What it Does and How it Works
The operator will connect a quality of air detector to the raspberry pi (via an ADC).
They will then enter the two week school timetable for the room it will be sitting in.
Then they will then go to the screen where the logger is set up.
They must select which week it is currently, check the time is correct in the program and import the timetable.
Backups can be setup optionally, as can graphs but both these can be setup anytime.
The operator then hits starts logging. They can leave the pi for however long and it will automatically record all data.


## Why?
Becuase the raspberry pi is a great way to get involved in tech and school. 
This is a rediculous idea to find the smelliest year group, it is involves complex programming and statisical analysis of data.
It is the first of many projects to get people involved in tech around school and children and teens how big data can be used to solve problems.
